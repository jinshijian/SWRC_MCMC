# SWRC_MCMC
In this repository we created a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to simulate soil water retention curve. This repository has following documents:

| File Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| MCMC_function.R  | Functions to simulate and get Van-Genuchten model parameters for soil water retention curve |
| Analysis_manuscript.Rmd| It is a R markdown file to reproduce all results for a manuscript in progress |
| Lu_2008_2013_Data.csv  | Soil water retention curve data obtained from doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113518 and doi:10.2136/sssaj2007.0307n |
| NCSS_MCMC2_reorder.csv | Soil water retention curve data for 1871 soils from the NCSS database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/ |
| RosettaFittedVG.csv | It holds soil water retention curve data from UNSODA |
